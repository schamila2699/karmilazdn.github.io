<h1     class="w3-center w3-text-pink" style="font-size: 100px;"><b>About Syasya</b></h1><br>
<p      class="w3-large w3-center w3-container w3-pink">

My name is Syasya Karmila Binti Zainuddin and I'm from one of the smallest islands in Malaysia, called Bandar Labuan. 
This island is also called Bandar <i>Victoria</i>, it's the capital of the Federal Territory of Labuan in Malaysia. 
It's known for a fact that the name Victoria is commonly used in honour the reign of Queen Victoria.

I have 3 siblings back in my hometown and I'm the second child. In my free time, I like to spend it by reading books or go for a workout. 
My family and I are very athletic, except for my youngest sister. My dad, my eldest sister and me are rugby player while my mother used to be a netball player.
My youngest sister would rather spend most of her time playing games.

<br>

I'm currently a full-time student in University Malaysia Pahang, enrolling a bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronics Automation Technology. 
This will be last semester and will be starting my Work-Based Learning and internship next year starting on March. 
Throughout my studies here, I'd say I'm not the smartest student in class but I'm grateful I have the will to learn 
new things in class. I hope that everything will be worth it when I get into the industry.
